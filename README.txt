Tiny Tennis Fun
Table tennis, also known as ping pong, is a game in which two or four players hit a little, light ball back and
forth across a table using a small paddle. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball to the other
player. Basically, you’re playing tiny tennis on a table. Sound like a game you can only play with friends, or
a wall? Not anymore! We have table-tennis games for all levels. The best part? You can play any time, anywhere –
no table or paddles required! That’s an added bonus if you’re stuck at work and can’t use your colleague's desk
to set up your own tournament.
Looking to improve your ping pong skills? Try the classic King Ping Pong, where you move the virtual paddle and
try to win the match. Feeling confident? Take your skills to the next level with Rio 2016. Experience the thrills
and excitement of the 2016 Rio Summer Games in this online version. Virtually travel to Rio and lead your nation
to victory! And if you’re looking for a fun twist on the classic table-tennis game try Bomb Pong. It’s basically
ping pong, but your ball is a bomb, so serve carefully!
